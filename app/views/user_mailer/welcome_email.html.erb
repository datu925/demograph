    <p>Don't forget - you can sign up for reminders and subscriptions on events of interest. This will send you an email some interval before an event (a day, three days, a week, etc.) letting you know what the anticipated gender ratio is, giving you a chance to reach out to friends or other organizations to re-balance and end up with a more integrated event.</p>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
